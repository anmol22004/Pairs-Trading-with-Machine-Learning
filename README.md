# Pairs-Trading-with-Machine-Learning
Pairs trading strategy is one of the most popular and successful quantitative methodology developed in 1980s by the team of scientists, mathematicians and computer scientists. 
The group is formed by the Wall Street quant Nunzio Tartaglia. The method was developed from the statistical model and computer algorithm without the decision from the human.

In this project, we utilize both price and technical indicators for our pairs trading strategy while most of
previous work only uses price to build pairs trading strategy. We also devise two new metrics to measure our strategy
because the traditional back-testing for return prediction is not our focus and can be not very useful since it involves
much more practical problems, such as slippage and transaction cost. Instead, we want to focus more on
directional prediction. The results show that our strategy is moderately predictive, and has slightly better performance on
predicting spread change direction than predicting profitable trades

## Result
After applying this pairs strategy on NSE equities over the span of 5 years from 2015 to 2019 we got some
handsome profits. From this technique we have found 48 pairs outperforms NIFTY-50(buy and hold for 5 years) with
maximum profit of 467% on single pair.
